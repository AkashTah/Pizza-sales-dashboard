## **Chart Requirements**

We need to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data through the following charts:

1. **Hourly Trend for Total Pizzas Sold**  
   - A stacked bar chart showing the hourly trend of total pizzas sold.  
   - This chart helps identify any patterns or fluctuations in order volumes on an hourly basis.

2. **Weekly Trend for Total Orders**  
   - A line chart illustrating the weekly trend of total orders throughout the year.  
   - This chart helps identify peak weeks or periods of high order activity.

3. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category**  
   - A pie chart representing the distribution of sales across different pizza categories.  
   - This chart helps understand the popularity of various pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales.

4. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size**  
   - A pie chart showing the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes.  
   - This chart highlights customer preferences for pizza sizes.

5. **Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category**  
   - A funnel chart that presents the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category.  
   - This chart helps compare the sales performance of different pizza categories.

6. **Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders**  
   - A bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on revenue, total quantity sold, and total orders.  
   - This chart helps identify the most popular pizza options.

7. **Bottom 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders**  
   - A bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on revenue, total quantity sold, and total orders.
